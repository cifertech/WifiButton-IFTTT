# WifiButton-IFTTT
Send a welcome message to the Telegram group by activating the versatile Wi-Fi key.

we are going to do this process in our Telegram group or Telegram channel. For example, by sending the versatile Wi-Fi key, send a welcome message to the group. This is done using the IFTTT telegram robot. This project is based on the services of the IFTTT site, which stands for if this then that.

### Why We Need API?
API stands for "Application Programming Interface". APIs have a long history, and a full explanation may require a full article. But in this post, I will try to explain its meaning more clearly to you. Suppose there is a site that provides meteorological information to users. If this site wants to send information to users on different platforms at the moment, it uses an API that the user can access the information by calling "Call".

### IFTTT Service
As I mentioned before, we are going to use the services of the IFTTT site in the tutorial. These services allow us to access other services such as Telegram and Webhooks. What we need in this tutorial. Now why IFTTT service? In fact, this word stands for If this then that. It means "if this then" that in fact if the event we have scheduled happens, what we have scheduled will happen. In this tutorial, by pressing the Wi-Fi key on ESP, an API is called by us. The required information will then be sent to our Telegram channel or group.
